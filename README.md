# Josh Palmer -- GitHub
Welcome! I'm Josh, a man who loves creating things. I'm particularly skilled at creating software. I also enjoy doing repairs, upgrades, maintenance, etc to other things around the house (and other peoples' houses). I'm a quick learner, and usually only need to be told or showed something once to be able to repeat it.
Ask me about algorithms & software design.
